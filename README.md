***Human readable password generator***

So, I had a problem with creating some passwords, that I could actually remember, without any need for the third party password-keeping software. Here I just have a list of about 300k words that can be combined with each other and result with a password. Also between the words some special characters and/or numbers will be put. Shout out to the kaggle.com/bwandowando for the words dataset!
It also chages "a" to the @ randomly, "i" to the 1 and "o" to the 0 randomly, if the special characters are enabled.
